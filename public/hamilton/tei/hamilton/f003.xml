			<line>These papers all so clearly evince the propriety</line>
			<line>of borrowing on a high interest, when were it may</line>
			<line>be necessary to borrow money, that I hope every</line>
			<line>future loan to the United States will be made</line>
			<line>on these principles. - and in order that no error</line>
			<line>may be made in the compacts with the lenders</line>
			<line>I have shown the terms which you will find</line>
			<line>[h-N-n] - Ever yours affectly</line>

			<line/>
			<line>Hon A. Hamilton Esqr</line>
			<line/>
			<line>P.S. whether you shall remain in or resign the Superintendence</line>
			<line>of the treasury department, it seems to me equally</line>
			<line>proper that you should establish the principle on which</line>
			<line>all future loans should be made, such as that the means</line>
			<line>of redemption should invariable be annexed to the loans</line>
			<line>[power] an accumulation of debt will always be</line>
			<line>prevented without additional burthens on the people</line>
			<line>and setting out on this system advantages will accrue</line>
			<line>which no nation having a public debt has ever [had]</line>
			<line>yet experienced. - the credit will be yours and</line>
			<line>posterity will bless your memory for having</line>
			<line>produced a system so replete with salutary</line>
			<line>consequences - once more affectionately yours,</line>
			<line/>
