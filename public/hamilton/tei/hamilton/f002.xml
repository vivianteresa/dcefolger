			<line>appears to me of sufficient weight to justify that man is [?]</line>
			<line>for not entering in the business, precisely in the manner</line>
			<line>proposed by Mr Gale, which you will recollect was to estimate</line>
			<line>the value of the new stock on the depreciated value of the</line>
			<line>[the] three per cents sh[ow]ing the mean value of the latter at</line>
			<line>63 1/3, by which the public would share [nearly] or rather</line>
			<line>recover nearly what they had lost by the enormous</line>
			<line>premiums which have been given but such an estimate of the three per cents</line>
			<line>might be considered as taking an undue advantage of the</line>
			<line>creditors, who [ought] would expect [ought] to be paid the nominal capital which</line>
			<line>they received for the money they lent, be the latter more or</line>
			<line>less - Indeed if the conversion was made on the nominal</line>
			<line>capital, the debt in the new stock would be greater, and consequently</line>
			<line>the greater revenue must be [applied] provided for payments</line>
			<line>of the interest, but still the power of the [lending?] fund</line>
			<line>[would] [app????] [from] t the redemption. If [irredeemably?] applied</line>
			<line>would be such, as in about 25 years to superceed the necessity</line>
			<line>of any loans for the payment of the annual tender for</line>
			<line>the redemption. - and thence forward (the revenue which at</line>
			<line>the commencement of the conversion was sufficient for the</line>
			<line>[first] years interest) would be an accumulating [something] [pounds]</line>
			<line>which would always keep the debt within moderate bounds</line>
			<line>nay at any point which prudence and the weal of the</line>
			<line>nation should dictate, even altho wars and their</line>
			<line>attendant expenses should prevail as often as they</line>
			<line>have done in the present century -</line>
